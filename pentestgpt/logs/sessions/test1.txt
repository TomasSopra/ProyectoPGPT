### Penetration Testing Tree (PTT):

1. Identify Open Ports and Services - (completed)
    1.1 Perform a full port scan on 52.143.160.143 - (completed)
    1.2 Determine the purpose of each open port on 52.143.160.143 - (completed)
        1.2.1 Run NSE scripts to check for port version on 52.143.160.143 - (completed)
            1.2.1.1 Port 1720: h323q931 - Version uncertain - (completed)
                1.2.1.1.1 Investigate the h323q931 service on port 1720 due to uncertain version detection - (completed)
            1.2.1.2 Port 3389: Microsoft Terminal Services - ms-wbt-server - (completed)
                1.2.1.2.1 Investigate potential vulnerabilities in Microsoft Terminal Services on port 3389 - (to-do)

### To-Do Tasks:
1.2.1.2.1 Investigate potential vulnerabilities in Microsoft Terminal Services on port 3389 - (to-do)

### Explanation:
To perform this task, use Nmap with the vulnerability detection script to gather more information about potential vulnerabilities in Microsoft Terminal Services by running the command:
nmap -sV -p 3389 --script=rdp-vuln-ms12-020 52.143.160.143

This will help identify if the service is vulnerable to the MS12-020 RDP vulnerability, which could be exploited for remote code execution.
