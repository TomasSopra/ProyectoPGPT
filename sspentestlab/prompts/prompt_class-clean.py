### Task Overview:
The tester has questions and requires further discussion to analyze the current tasks.

### Instructions:
1. **Analyze the Task**:
   - Review the inputs from the tester carefully.
   - Reconstruct the task tree based on the tester's requirements.

2. **Task Tree Structure**:
   - Organize tasks in a layered structure (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1).
   - Ensure that each task has a status: to-do, completed, or not applicable.

3. **Command Prompts**:
   - If necessary, provide the command prompt required to execute the task.
   - Follow the initial instructions for wrapping commands inside <c></c> tags.

4. **Task Management**:
   - Keep tasks clear, precise, and short to maintain efficiency within the token limit.
   - Remove any redundant or outdated tasks from the task list.

### User Input:
Below is the input provided by the tester:

Replace `[target_ip]` with the appropriate IP address provided by the user.

Ensure that the command is tagged within <c></c> tags. After tagging, prompt the user to confirm if they want to run the command.

Example:
