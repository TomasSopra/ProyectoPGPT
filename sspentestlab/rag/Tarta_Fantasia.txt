Title: Enchanted Dream Cake

Ingredients:

2 cups of Stardust Flour
1 cup of Moonbeam Sugar
3 tablespoons of Unicorn Butter
4 Dragon Eggs
1 teaspoon of Phoenix Feather Baking Powder
1 pinch of Mermaid Salt
1 cup of Elven Milk
1 tablespoon of Fairy Dust Vanilla Extract
1 cup of Rainbow Berries
1 vial of Liquid Sunshine
Tools:

Enchanted Mixing Bowl
Wand Whisk
Spellbound Oven
Crystal Cake Pan
Time-Turner Timer
Levitation Spatula
Instructions:

Preparation:
Preheat your Spellbound Oven to 350°F (or 180°C). The Spellbound Oven ensures even baking with a touch of magic.
Grease your Crystal Cake Pan with a bit of Unicorn Butter to prevent sticking.
Mixing the Batter:
In the Enchanted Mixing Bowl, combine the Stardust Flour, Moonbeam Sugar, and Phoenix Feather Baking Powder. Use the Wand Whisk to blend the dry ingredients until they shimmer with a magical glow.
In a separate bowl, beat the Dragon Eggs until they are light and frothy. Add the Elven Milk and Fairy Dust Vanilla Extract, and mix well.
Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture, stirring gently with the Levitation Spatula. The batter should be smooth and slightly iridescent.
Adding the Magic:
Fold in the Rainbow Berries and a pinch of Mermaid Salt. The berries will add bursts of color and flavor, while the salt enhances the magical properties of the cake.
Finally, add the vial of Liquid Sunshine. This will give the cake a warm, golden hue and a hint of citrusy brightness.
Baking:
Pour the batter into the prepared Crystal Cake Pan. Use the Time-Turner Timer to set the baking time to 30 minutes. The Time-Turner Timer ensures perfect timing, so your cake is never over or under-baked.
Place the pan in the Spellbound Oven and let the magic happen. The cake will rise beautifully, filling your kitchen with an enchanting aroma.
Finishing Touches:
Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a cooling rack to cool completely.
Decorate the cake with a sprinkle of extra Fairy Dust Vanilla Extract for a sparkling finish.
Serving:
Slice the Enchanted Dream Cake with a Moonbeam Knife and serve on plates made of Dragon Scale. Each bite will transport you to a world of fantasy and delight.
